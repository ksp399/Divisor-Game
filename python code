EXPLANTION:

1. If Alice will lose for N, then Alice will must win for N+1, since Alice can first just make N decrease 1.
2. For any odd number N, it only has odd factor, so after the first move, it will be an even number
let's check the inference
fisrt N = 1, Alice lose. then Alice will must win for 2.
if N = 3, since all even number(2) smaller than 3 will leads Alice win, so Alice will lose for 3
3 lose -> 4 win
all even number(2,4) smaller than 5 will leads Alice win, so Alice will lose for 5
...

Therefore, Alice will always win for even number, lose for odd number.
